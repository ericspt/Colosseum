# Colosseum

This is an open-source project for an exciting turn-based online arrow-hitting game.

# Story of the game

You are a legendary warrior that starts from 0 and need to work your way up the ranks and get better equipment and skills. 
The game is pretty basic, since it's an arrow-hitting game; 
But the action behind the scenes is the exciting part: buying equipment, learning new skills, and deciding what skills you're going to use in battle.
